# Polyjuice

Character-Cloning bot written in Python to mimic characters in harry potter.

## Updates

**2024.01.11**
We update new command:"/polymorph". With the command, giving a name of the character you want, chatting thread is created, with gpt responsing as the character.

**2024.01.15**
We are relaxing the degree of moderation. We reduced the moderating values by a fifth.

**2024.01.22**
MiiiRo - I corrected our my mistake: set all the moderating values as 1.0.

We added the checker if the character users write may exist in Harry Potter,

and updated thread's frontend.

**2024.01.23**
We added the name corrector for the case users get a little confused about the name.

**2024.02.10**
We fixed some instructions not working well:

- Telling the correct character name of user's request

- Try for gpt not to recognize itself not mimicing

And eliminate the example conversations.
